In recent years, SCPs have grown due to their perceived benefits compared to traditional funding channels. However, skepticism remains regarding the potential for the further development of crowdfunding platforms, especially SCPs, due to restrictions on attracting investment as well as concerns related to transparency, reliability, and trustworthiness. The recent applications of blockchain technology in crowdfunding promise a possible solution to current obstacles, and may facilitate SCPs. Employing a qualitative research approach based on three case studies, this study addresses how blockchain technology can be used to facilitate the social value creation of crowdfunding when adopted as an alternative infrastructure. Accordingly, this study identifies both the facilitators of the social value creation process through blockchain technology (e.g., reducing operational costs, increasing trust and transparency, and cultivating a broader crowdfunding community) and the barriers of this application in terms of development costs and legal requirements. In addition to answering calls to investigate the role of blockchains in facilitating social activities, this study expands the emerging literature by demonstrating the practical applications of blockchain use in crowdfunding.;"Crowdfunding; Blockchain; Social crowdfunding; Social value creation";;https://doi.org/10.1016/j.techfore.2021.120898

It bears similarity to conventional crowdfunding, but has its own unique characteristics. Therefore the success factors that affect the outcome of traditional crowdfunding may have a different impact on blockchain-based crowdfunding. Despite that the number of blockchain-based crowdfunding campaigns has increased drastically in the past few years, there is a lack of good understanding of what the success factors are for them in comparison to the ones for conventional crowdfunding. Such understanding is crucial for companies to design their blockchain-based fundraising initiatives properly and facilitate potential investors to seek main signals and drivers of outstanding projects. Furthermore it could help regulators and market participants to understand how the existing regulatory framework applies to blockchain-based crowdfunding. Due to specific characteristics of blockchain-based crowdfunding, regulatory frameworks may require potential re-interpretation of requirements to allow an effective application of regulations. To fill this knowledge gaps, we have reviewed a set of relevant literature on success factors for conventional and blockchain-based crowdfunding. The result of this literature review sheds light on the directions for future research and development. The contribution of our work is a better understanding of the distinctions and similarities of blockchain-based crowdfunding compared to traditional crowdfunding.;"Crowdfunding; non-financial vs financial; Blockchain-based crowdfunding";https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=8666515;

However, cyber-insurance has not been widely accepted due to several obstacles. First, the lack of reliable data to measure the cyber-risks makes it hard to calculate the insurance premium. Second, there are legal and procedural hurdles for assessing the organizations security posture deterring insurer for auditing. On the other hand, the blockchain technology has been extensively popularized due to its ability to provide transparency and security. Blockchain applies the distributed ledger to store transaction histories, and the information is stored across a network of computers instead of on a single server. In order to improve the application of the cyber-insurance, in this research, we propose a new framework to insure a cyber-product using the blockchain technology. First, a vendor initiates a request for insuring a cyber-product, then the interested insurers participate in a sealed-bid auction by bidding their preferred premium for the insurance service. The auction winners will be selected as the insurers, and they receive tokens in return of their obligations. In the case of an indemnity request, the auditor checks the validity of a request, then calls the claim function to retrieve the corresponding amount from the funds collected from the insurers. Furthermore, we propose a new method to implement a sealed-bid auction for the insurance crowdfunding in smart contract.;"Cyber-insurance; Blockchain; Crowdfunding; Sealed-bid auction";https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=8796515;

Recently, a blockchain use case called Initial Coin Offering (ICO) draws a lot of attention. ICO is a novel form of crowdfunding that utilizes blockchain tokens to allow for truly peer-to-peer investments. Although, more than 4.5 billion USD have been invested via ICOs, the phenomenon is poorly understood. Scientific research lacks a structured classification of ICOs to provide further insights into their characteristics. We bridge this gap by developing a taxonomy based on real-world ICO cases, related literature, and expert interviews. Further, we derive and discuss prevailing ICO archetypes. Our findings contribute to theory development in the field of ICOs by enriching the descriptive knowledge, identifying design options, deriving ICO archetypes, and laying the foundation for further research. Additionally, our research provides several benefits for practitioners. Our proposed taxonomy illustrates that there is no one-size-fits-all model of ICOs and might support the decisionmaking process of start-ups, investors and regulators. The proposed ICO archetypes indicate how common ICOs are designed and thus might serves as best practices. Finally, our analysis indicates that ICOs represent a valid alternative to traditional crowdfunding approaches.;Blockchain, Smart Contract, Initial Coin Offering (ICO), Token, Token Sales, Cryptocurrency, Crowdfunding, Taxonomy. ;https://www.fim-rc.de/Paperbibliothek/Veroeffentlicht/730/wi-730.pdf;

The Disruptive Role of Crowdfunding & Blockchain: A Systematic Literature Review;European Journal of Islamic Finance;;17;;2021;;The aim of this article is to examine the literature on the role of two dominant players within the FinTech world in recent years: on the one hand, crowdfunding and on the other, blockchain. Our focus will be on the traditionally static and non-innovative real estate sector, trying to analyse how the latter can benefit from the use and interaction between these two new actors. Through a systematic literature review (SLR), 143 scientific articles based on current literature have been identified to better understand the topic. The information collected from the selected articles is presented and summarised in specific tables and graphs for a more immediate understanding. The qualitative research software Nvivo was also used. This research found 43 out of 143 articles analyse the phenomenon of crowdfunding based on blockchain technology from an economic point of view. After the descriptive results through qualitative analysis, the evidence that emerged is that none of the articles analysed deals with the issue in terms of real estate to understand possible practical implications and further theoretical contributions. This research work suggests to investors who intend to invest in real estate, how new investment methodologies could bring enormous benefits to a sector that is less prone to innovation and traditionally static, considering how the use of new technologies applied to alternative financing instruments would make real estate investments much more attractive and accessible. This study contributes to advancing knowledge of the FinTech world, specifically of new alternative financing instruments such as crowdfunding and new emerging technologies such as blockchain, from a theoretical point of view.

Using crowdfunding, people can put resources into pioneering businesses through a middle medium or platform. The issue with the current crowd funding technique is that, third party medium don't give the assurance of the money investor contributed for the project and investor don't have control over the cash they contributed. This paper proposes the blockchain based crowd funding by using which the platform can give a private, secure and decentralized path for crowdfunding. The main objective of this paper is to let investors contribute to any project effectively by creating smart contracts through which the contributors can have a control over the invested money and also both the project creators and investors can effectively make and reserve funding for the project.;"Ethereum; smart contracts; crowdfunding";https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=9214295;

People who are interested in a project can donate by making an online transaction. The donated money goes to the project manager, which he uses to complete the project or to make a product. This existing method of online crowdfunding has a major drawback. It does not allow contributors to have control over the money they have contributed. Since in the existing method the project manager has all the control over the money contributed he can very easily perform malicious activities. Here we address this problem faced by the existing online crowdfunding platforms by using ethereum network and smart contract. The development of Blockchain technology has allowed businesses to build decentralized models. It has derived new methods to conduct transactions and make agreements. One of the technologies that propose an alternative to the traditional model is the smart contract. A smart contract is similar to a contract in the physical world, but it is digital and represented by a tiny computer program stored in a blockchain. These smart contracts can be used to implement logic. A method has been proposed here that uses smart contract to manage all the activities performed in a crowdfunding campaign. The proposed method has been implemented and its various features are tested by funding campaigns on rinkeby test network.;"Blockchain; Crowdfunding; Ethereum; Smart Contracts; Solidity";https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=8991341;

"Sahdev, Navroop K; ";Crowdfunding meets blockchain;Available at SSRN 3047682;;;;2017;;"Blockchain, the technology behind Bitcoin, promises to be nothing less than Internet 2.0. The financial services industry, in particular, is preparing for the disruption blockchain/distributed ledger technology promises to cause. In the current business environment, the majority of startups and small businesses have to look for alternative sources of funding given that ?going public? is increasingly expensive. The crowdfunding space has seen tremendous growth as an alternative way to raise capital by businesses. However, these crowdfunded shares cannot be traded for 7-10 years on average on any given platform in the U.S. currently.

To build a trading platform on the blockchain which is completely P2P, immutable, fully transparent and low cost presents some key design issues. In particular, the issue of liquidity - and price discovery - on the blockchain continues to be a puzzle. At the same time, the proposition of removing middlemen from equities trading is a very attractive one, streamlining the process of capital formation with higher market efficiency.

The current paper addresses the following key questions: How can a DLT trading platform ensure adequate liquidity? What would be the process of price discovery? While some recent studies hail blockchain technology as a boom for market liquidity, it is not immediately clear what the impact of P2P trading would be on the prices of various stocks. There are no ?solutions? just yet. At the same time, the lack of regulation around trading on the blockchain creates an environment of uncertainty for all players.

In particular, the implementation of such a platform can revolutionize capital formation and build robust markets in both developing and developed countries where crowdfunding has proven to be a successful model. While my research is targeted at solving a very specific pain point for both researchers and companies working on distributed ledger technology, ultimately, it would be a significant step forward towards onboarding underserved communities across the world who don?t have access to financial services.";;https://papers.ssrn.com/sol3/Delivery.cfm/SSRN_ID3047682_code2635527.pdf?abstractid=3047682&mirid=1;

Within this new energy system framework, the idea of crowd-sourced equity funding of the capital cost of renewable energy is introduced. The impact of crowdfunded equity on the LCOE is then explored via the creation of a theoretical offshore wind installation off the coast of New Jersey. An existing offshore wind capital cost model is modified for use in the U.S., and an existing wind annual energy production model is utilized to provide inputs into a LCOE model. Finally, the potential impacts that DLT based crowdfunded equity may have on cost of debt, debt tenor, and debt-to-equity ratio are also input into the LCOE model in order to examine the range of potential impacts it may have on offshore wind LCOE.;;https://ntnuopen.ntnu.no/ntnu-xmlui/bitstream/handle/11250/2733259/Cali-Potential+impacts+of+blockchain.pdf?sequence=2;

It works through individuals or organisations who invest in (or donate to) crowdfunding projects in return for a potential profit or reward. Investing this way can be risky. Security is the main challenging issue in crowdfunding contracts. Using existing literature on crowdfunding and blockchain technology, they put forward a conceptual framework that can provide the solution to the problems related to crowdfunding contracts using blockchain technology. This methodology points out the potential of crowdfunding decentralised applications to lower market inefficiencies by bypassing third parties and easing trades on secondary markets. This platform eliminates the interference of the middlemen. It is highly transparent and secure. A decentralised approach to crowdfunding forfeits all fees for the investor. It also gives a share of the project to the receiver. This model establishes a flexible platform for the fundraiser to start a campaign. The funders invest the amount if they feel the project to be genuine. Once 50% of the funds are received, it will be transferred to the initiator. It establishes a peer-to-peer relationship between the investor and the receiver.

Part I provides a brief history of the Reg. CF exemption law and the research findings about investment crowdfunding, generally, and digital tokens, more specifically. Next, Part II provides insights on the current state of offering blockchain-based digital tokens to unsophisticated investors and the silver linings in the data. Finally, Part III provides recommendations for a path forward in Reg. CF. First, the SEC should re-evaluate its regulatory policy in light of the proliferation of blockchain-based token offerings and gaps in funding portals, and provide additional warnings to unsophisticated investors who may be taking on enhanced investment risk. The uncertainty and risk of digital tokens reliant on blockchain technology foretells a troubling high risk of investment loss, which may supplement the expected high risk of loss for startup tech companiees. Second, companies, particularly idealistic tech startups, that are considering the offer of digital tokens, should thoughtfully consider alternatives to these offerings. There remains a level of uncertainty and risk in these offerings, which could result in greater risk and liability than the alternative financing available to them. Lastly, economic development organizations should consider developing their role in attracting, designing, and implementing funding portals to provide the support that tech and other startup companies need to raise capital for their business.;Regulation Crowdfunding, digital tokens, blockchain, capital formation, safe harbor exemptions, innovation, securities offerings, investment crowdfunding;https://scholarship.law.stjohns.edu/cgi/viewcontent.cgi?article=7104&context=lawreview;

In today's world whenever an entrepreneur wants to implement his idea into the real world, he needs some money to bring his idea to life. Earlier when crowdfunding platform were not available the entrepreneur were able to target only a limited number of people for funding of the project also it was very difficult for them to reach out to the people who can fund the project. Now a day's a number of crowdfunding platform like Kickstarter exists which allows the entrepreneur to post their ideas on the platform where backers can see the project and can contribute some amount of money to that project. These crowdfunding platforms made it easier for the entrepreneur to reach out to a large crowd worldwide who can support their project. In the existing crowdfunding system, despite having many advantages there are some problem related to these systems such as charging a huge amount of money for maintenance, transparency in the system, and trust. Our application can remove these problems related to the existing crowdfunding system by providing a more transparent system where every transaction can be stored on the blockchain using the Smart Contracts.;Crowdfunding, Blockchain, Smart Contracts, Transparency, Entrepreneur;https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=9573956;

To facilitate crowdfunding, different crowdfunding platforms are available, such as Kickstarter and Indiegogo. Crowdfunding platforms provide a convenient way of raising funds for startups from investors. The major downside of the conventional crowdfunding platforms is that they require users to pay few percentages of the fundraised to the crowdfunding platforms as platform fees (e.g., Kickstarter charges 5% of the total fundraised as platform fee). In addition to platform fee, users are required to pay transaction fees to the payment processors. In this paper, we propose a secure and decentralized crowdfunding mechanism based on blockchain technology. The proposed crowdfunding mechanism eliminates the need of conventional crowdfunding platforms that charge entrepreneurs a sum of money as platform fees. The proposed mechanism allows entrepreneurs to make use of the total fundraised from investors and provides an immutable ledger of transactions between investors and entrepreneurs.;"Blockchain; Crowdfunding; Ethereum; Smart contracts";;https://doi.org/10.1007/978-981-15-7533-4_7

In conventional crowdfunding, one faces many issues such as transparency issues, fraudulent issues, investor abuse etc. However, to overcome these issues, blockchain crowdfunding comes into play. Blockchain crowdfunding helps to overcome the issues faced in conventional crowdfunding. To implement blockchain crowdfunding, we have proposed a model named ?Block Funding?, which is made using Ethereum smart contracts. It consists of a web app made of React/Next.js and Ethereum smart contracts used in the backend. It primarily focuses on all the basic crowdfunding features as well as voting through blockchain.

The Blockchain integrated network provides benefits such as increased security, increased transparency, increased efficiency and decreased chances of fraud. Although the blockchain-based systems provide various benefits, due to lack of knowledge about this technology, the implementation rate is low. In this work, we have highlighted the distinction between the traditional crowdfunding platform as well as blockchain network-based crowdfunding platform and the benefits of implementing blockchain network in other sectors. This work highlights the issues and challenges faced by the industries, as mentioned earlier, by using the traditional methods as well as the solutions to the problems provided by the blockchain network-based systems to those industries. This work helps the people to understand the benefits of blockchain network-based systems in their respective industries as well as execute it to improve the transparency, efficiency, and security of the system altogether. ;Blockchain, Crowdfunding, e-Voting, Ethereum, Cryptocurrency;https://www.academia.edu/download/69795924/IRJET_V8I41024.pdf;

Jul;2021;IEEE;Blockchain-based crowdfunding is one of the new, upcoming alternatives to the traditional centralized approach to crowdfunding. Traditional crowdfunding platforms are vulnerable to data leaks, high transaction and platform fees, and rampant frauds which happens due to the anonymity of user?s identity i.e., users cannot be identified when they commit cybercrimes. As blockchain is immutable and decentralized, it can reduce the possibility of data breaches. This brings in transparency as there is no central authority over the blockchain-based crowdfunding system. This paper attempts to solve these existing issues with the aid of a digital identity management system with an underlying Blockchain system. By implementing blockchain in a digital identity management system, malicious users can be identified and action can be taken against them.

The present paper investigates the driving forces of equity crowdfunding and the impact of the blockchain.

Design: In a two-round, expert-based Delphi survey, ten market-driving forces within equity crowdfunding are identified and ranked according to how they influence equity crowdfunding, and in turn, how they are influenced by blockchain technology.

Findings: Savings and financial benefits, facilitation of the financing process, satisfaction of intrinsic and social needs, outreach of projects and products, costs from equity funding, and financial provision were found to have a positive effect, whereas risks from equity crowdfunding, educational gap, investor protection, and monitoring problems and asymmetric information were found to have a negative impact on equity funding.

Research limitations: Any Delphi study depends on the selection and interactive votings of experts.

Practical implications: Experts assessed that the blockchain has a positive influence on all of those forces, also to a certain extent counteracting negative effects. This indicates that Equity Crowdfunding Based on the Blockchain can be viable approach for financing startups if the counteracting effects are sufficiently mitigated.

This can be an individual or an organization that merely wants to contribute for a noble cause. In layman terms, it can be referred to as funding given by an anonymous crowd with a belief that they are helping a section of the society to fight and overcome their monetary problems. This is being achieved via the Internet where people or groups raise funds to help others during a natural catastrophe or some community-oriented social projects, entrepreneurial ventures, travel, medical expenses and many more. The present-day scenario is such that once people transfer money into a particular venture no one knows what happens to the money generated. As a solution, one needs to track down the flow of money and thereby maintaining appropriate transparency. We propose an approach through this paper, of a decentralized system built using Blockchain Technology where once the investor funds money to a venture the transactions will be captured. If in case, the endeavor initiated accumulates the money within the stipulated time then it is utilized or else the money is returned back to the investor. This platform will eliminate the middlemen completely. It is transparent and more secure and thus acts as a huge savior for the people in need.

Traditional market participants such as banks, investment advisors and institutional investors are beginning to face disruptive pressure from a wide array of advances in financial technology, or 'fin tech'. New forms of competition have emerged, seeking to address perceived inefficiencies in various core business lines of the financial system, including lending money, raising capital and transmitting money between individuals. As this transformation plays out, regulators will need to adapt existing regulatory structures or create new ones to keep up. In particular, they must find the proper balance between protecting consumers from abuse while also allowing these new technologies to modernize and improve financial markets. This chapter focuses on three of these recent developments in closer detail: marketplace lending, crowdfunding and blockchain technology. While the applications differ, all three rely on a common model: eliminating the role of traditional intermediaries and thus enabling market participants to connect and transact with each other directly. This form of ?dis-intermediation? promises speed and efficiency, as processes like approving loan applications, raising capital and transferring money can now take mere seconds (or less) instead of days or weeks. At the same time, it also creates risk for consumers, as highly regulated entities such as banks stand to be replaced by software applications and peer-topeer networks that largely sit outside of existing regulatory frameworks. Regulators must carefully develop policies that maximize the benefits of these technologies for consumers while mitigating their costs.;;;https://doi.org/10.4337/9781785362637.00018

"Hamilton, J Christopher; ";Crowdfunding & Cryptocurrency-A New Conduit to Film Finance;Rutgers Bus. LJ;16;;94;2020;HeinOnline;"Despite the normal volatility in the film industry, it remains as robust as ever and is projected to grow to $47.9 billion dollars by 2022, slightly outpacing the U.S. economy. Prior to the latest wave of media consolidation, seven major studios controlled four-fifths of the film industry's revenue in 2017. Superhero films and other costly genres represent a large portion of that revenue, which have dominated the marketplace. This over- indexing in the production of genre films is a result of the major studios trying to generate massive audiences by producing tent pole pictures. The combined industry box office revenue in 2018 was almost 3.3 billion, largely due to the success of genre films. However, these types of revenues do not cultivate much of an appetite in the industry for funding arthouse films. Nor does this trend of massive budgets bode well for the inevitability bursting the spending bubble or a mega picture flop.
The increased fragmentation of viewing audiences, the shrinking theatrical windows, and the exploitation of the indie film market by streaming services like Netflix, has shifted the economics of the film business. From the arthouse moviemaker to the major studio producer or film financier/venture capitalist, everyone is looking for new diversified investors to help mitigate their risk and stabilize their investments through strategic co-financing models. That is why many in the entertainment business see the emergence of crowdfunding and cryptocurrency as the answer to some of these film financing dilemmas. Through changes in equity crowdfunding legislation combined with new technological advances like blockchain, producers may be able to effectively hedge their costly investments, while generating a more expansive investor pool to fund the dearth of arthouse pictures.
These high-tech innovations, new business models and legislative advancements promise to overcome the longstanding barriers to progressive changes in the film industry like combating inefficient and unfair business practices and the exclusivity of film investments as an asset class limited to the wealthy and well-connected. There are still lots of regulatory, technological and credibility hurdles to surmount before crowdfunding with cryptocurrency becomes a viable or practical industry-wide solution for raising capital. But there's strong evidence that the latter might be a real possibility sooner than we think. Equity crowdfunding coupled with cryptocurrency through blockchain will be the key to unlocking that future capital. So, whether cryptocurrency through blockchain helps connect unbanked communities to the global economy, supplant Byzantine bureaucracies in film financing or just guarantees fair dealing in a business transaction with potentially dubious investors, it will certainly live up to its moniker as the internet 2.0 for Hollywood. Revolutionizing film finance is now more important than ever as the Covid- 19 tsunami envelopes the entertainment business and our global economy.";;https://3ebed0a6-bdf9-4f9f-bdb5-8d619ef65e5f.filesusr.com/ugd/b8c02f_08b9592d62f04183b9feea68bd6f7dce.pdf;
